----- Details on the Project -----

First of all it is by no mean a real website and it is bound to be changed a lot.
We do not claim the images and descritions to be our own and all rights go to their owner !

-> We would like for the website to get some more things :
	- A responsive design
	- The possibility to buy products (which would reduce the stock in the database)
	- Taking into account the stock of a product when adding product in the cart
	- Diversifying the variety of the products
	- Adding a review function with evalutions from users
	- Adding an administrator side on the website (to manage comments, add products, etc)
	- Completing the filters and search bar (searching for tags and not only the name of a product for example)
	- Update the code to be simpler and more efficient
	- Forgot password function for the connexion

Despise of all these things missing here, we are proud of what our team did in the three weeks duration of the project !
